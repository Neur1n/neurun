# runner
A shell command running wrapper for Neovim and (maybe) Vim.

Since it is written for my very personal usage instead of for general purpose
like [asyncrun.vim](https://github.com/skywind3000/asyncrun.vim) does, the code
depends on some of my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/Neur1n/dotfiles/blob/master/neovim/autoload/neur1n).
